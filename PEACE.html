								<p>On the 27th day of November, we watched LPU’s Christmas tree lighting together. Do you remember? Although the so-called tree’s design was a bit distasteful and the lighting wasn’t that grand, I still enjoyed watching it because I was with you. We didn’t hold hands or kiss, but I felt the tingling one would feel when doing all those.</p>
								<p>Minutes before they turned the lights on, I took my phone out to record the moment because I knew I wouldn’t be looking at the tree when it happened. While everyone gazed at the lights with awe, I stared at the girl beside me. That was the time I understood that my feelings weren’t just a simple high school crush anymore. For the first time, I found peace in a person, and you didn’t even do anything; you just stood there. Somehow, I felt a sense of peace just by looking at you. It was the kind of peace I only feel when I stare at city lights, but even better. </p>
								<p>We had been talking for weeks before that day, and you have slowly introduced me to some parts of yourself. I never expected you to be that ‘corny’, but I loved it. I didn’t know the “Francheska Jayectin” had that in her. You had interesting quirks, like your obsession with blurting out the word “oten”. I thought you were the kind to give people looks when they say such words, and I love that I was wrong about it. I genuinely found you to be an interesting person. Someone that I was really eager to learn more about. How blessed I am to have been given the chance to get to know you more and, I wish, for the rest of my life.</p>
