								<p>Finally, the Christmas and New Year celebrations were over, and we decided to have a date at Azuela Cove on January 7th. This was our first date that didn’t take place right after school. I still remember picking you up at your house; I was so nervous. You looked so beautiful in your blue sweater and mini skirt. </p>
								<p>We brought the gifts we had bought for each other. You had wrapped my gifts nicely, while mine were just in a Miniso plastic bag. I felt embarrassed about my lack of effort, but you were still so grateful and excited about what I had picked out for you. We strolled around Azuela Cove for a little while, took pictures, and admired the scenery together. It was so romantic, and I really enjoyed that time with you. By the time we decided to walk back to my car, it was already dark. On our way back, we talked, shared our thoughts, and call that. </p>
								<p>One might say what we did wasn’t much. There was nothing grand about it; we simply hung out. Yet, during that seemingly “normal” hangout, I came to the quiet realization that I have fallen in love with you. Not because of anything dramatic, but because being with you just felt right.</p>
