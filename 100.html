								<p>I actually wrote this last month pa. Remember when we were on call and you kept on asking what I was doing, and then I told you I was writing "notes" for Philo? Yeah, I was actually writing this. This was supposed to be given to you handwritten, but then I contemplated whether to give it to you or not, cause my handwriting on the letter was so ugly. The letter is two bond paper long, back-to-back, oh and it's the long size too. And then I thought, no way I'll let you suffer, trying to understand the messy letters and lopsided sentences I wrote, and so here we are. </p>

								<h1>100 Things I love about my baby </h1>
								</div>
								<p>1. I love that you're soulful. You feel deeply and understand things from a perspective that is uniquely yours.</p>
								<p>2. I love how you appreciate the little things in life most people don't care about. How you long for memories that have already passed, how you smile at the sight of the beautifully scattered sunlight through the leaves of a tree, how you find charm in the cute prints on everyday things like plates or mugs. I love the way you laugh at the comically arranged books on the shelves of NBS, or at the random vandals and signs with accidental sexual meanings, and how your eyes light up whenever you see vintage lamps in the places we visit. I hope you know that you’ve taught me another way to live.</p>
								<p>3. I love how you come to realizations that most wouldn't even come close to reflecting upon themselves. Like acknowledging how your past played a huge part in who you are now, and bad experiences as redirections. Truly, you’ve taken “everything happens for a reason” to heart.</p>
								<p>4. I love how hearing you talk always opens up a new perspective for me.</p>
								<p>5. I love all the characters that make you. You’re sweet (kahit maldita ka minsan), funny, understanding, soulful, intelligent, thoughtful, conscientious, practical, sentimental,and many more. </p>
								<p>6. I love all the physical features that make up my super duper yummy, sexy, delicious girlfriend. First of all, I love your eyes. They remind me of a cat’s. I love your plump lips, which look like what I imagine perfect lips would look like. They are so lip-shaped. I love your curves and how my fingers feel when I trace them. You’re perfect and beautiful the way you are.</p>
								<p>7. I love how you make funny faces whenever I compliment you, as if the “funny faces” don’t make you more adorable in my eyes. Ganyan ka kiligin ‘noh?</p>
								<p>8. I love how you look at me with that pouty, pleading look whenever you want something from me, but don’t want to verbally say it. </p>
								<p>9. I love that you’re slowly letting me in and do stuff for you even though I know how independent you are. Thank you for letting me take care of you, baby.</p>
								<p>10. I love how beautiful you look walking towards my car whenever I sundo you. It’s like I fall in love all over again. My heart still gets thumpy as if it’s our first time on a date.</p>
								<p>11. I love it when you get excited over the smallest things and how you squeal; it’s so cute. I feel like I get to witness how young Cheska was like.</p>
								<p>12. I love how pinkish your face gets when you’re hot. Something about it is just so attractive to me. Maybe I’m just too in love.</p>
								<p>13. I love how you sing your heart out whenever you feel like it. Kung ano-ano lang jud trip mo, and most of the time, very random siya; I love that. I enjoy watching you enjoy music with feelings. I love your singing voice, no joke.</p>
								<p>14. I love how you suddenly yap about things whenever a specific word is mentioned that triggers your memory.</p>
								<p>15. I love how your voice gets soft whenever I tell you things.</p>
								<p>16. I love how from time to time, you have different fixations like when I first known you, you liked mofusands, then Snoopy, and then Miffy, and then now, Nailong.</p>
								<p>17. I love how you detach yourself from Social Media whenever you feel like you’re being unproductive cause of it. Very disciplined.</p>
								<p>18. I love that you love preserving things that belong to a memory you would like a physical reminder of. Like when you book-pressed, or whatever process you call it, the bouquet of flowers I gave you.</p>
								<p>19. I love how you always try to make the most out of everything. You hate the word “sayang”.</p>
								<p>20. I love how serious your face gets when you lock in to focus on studying. So sexy of you.</p>
								<p>21. I love how cute you sound when you sneeze.</p>
								<p>22. I love how you cheekily say, “oop, I’m gonna fart,” before farting.</p>
								<p>23. I love how addicting your scent is.</p>
								<p>24. I love all your quirks. I love how you say the cringiest lines or crack the corniest jokes.</p>
								<p>25. I love your smile and even more your laugh. So pretty.</p>
								<p>26. I love your dirty mind. I love how you say “oten” in the most random times. I love it when you jokingly moan.</p>
								<p>27. I love how your body twitches whenever I touch your sensitive parts. </p>
								<p>28. I love it when you spam me with TikToks because then I get to see what my pretty girl has been up to in the past few minutes. I love being included in anything related to you.</p>
								<p>29. I love how beautiful you look when we’re stuck in traffic, and it’s dark, so the brake lights of the car in front of us are the only thing that illuminates your pretty face.</p>
								<p>30. I love how your face lights up when the food is good. Let’s try out all the restaurants in the world together, baby.</p>
								<p>31. I love how beautiful you look when we’re on call and you’re in your house clothes. There are times when you ask me what I’m doing, sometimes I lie and say “scrolling…” when I was actually just watching you the whole time, imagining what it would be like to hold you every day, because I wouldn’t want to seem so obsessed over you, cause baka ma-creep out ka :p..</p>
								<p>32. I love it when you mimic accents. I find it both funny and impressive how accurately you can do them.</p>
								<p>33. I love how flowers remind me of you now. I used to feel nothing towards it, but I’ve learned to appreciate its beauty. Whenever I see flower shops, I stop by and admire the bouquets while thinking of you and how you’d love them.</p>
								<p>34 I love it when you share your interests with me, whether it’s about the lashes you’d want to try on, the matcha cafes you’d like to visit, or the foods you want to taste. I love learning more about you every day. </p>
								<p>35. I love how you acknowledge my feelings. Thank you for making me feel seen. I hope I make you feel the same way.</p>
								<p>36. I love how you communicate your feelings to me. It teaches me how to be careful with your heart.</p>
								<p>37. I love how when you drink something, your front teeth peek out. It’s so cute; you’re so cute.</p>
								<p>38. I love how beautiful you look while doing your makeup. The amount of self-control I need to hold myself back from ruining it is so draining…</p>
								<p>39. I love how beautiful you look while taking pictures using your digi cam. I feel so lucky to have witnessed the behind-the-scenes of some of your posted pictures.</p>
								<p>40. I love how alluring you sound while I pleasure you.</p>
								<p>41. I love how beautiful you look while I do you.</p>
								<p>42. I love witnessing your raw, unfiltered self. I would have never guessed you had this kind of side behind your poised, intimidating facade.</p>
								<p>43. I love how, at times, you get competitive. I find it kind of hot.</p>
								<p>44. I love it when you’re hyper at times. Para kang child who has had too much sugar.</p>
								<p>45. I also still love it when you’re quiet or when your social battery is drained. I’m witnessing something a part of you, and I love that.</p>
								<p>46. I love having mature conversations with you. I get reminded I’m dating someone emotionally intelligent. How lucky I truly am.</p>
								<p>47. I love it when you show me how significantly better you are at things than I am. It kind of turns me on fr.</p>
								<p>48. I love that we can be freaks together. Rawr.</p>
								<p>49. I love that you’re the best friend I never knew I needed. </p>
								<p>50. I love how you always want to sit together everywhere. Ikaw ha, so obsessed with me.</p>
								<p>51. I love how beautiful you look while holding it together in public, while I touch you underneath.</p>
								<p>52. I love your sense of humor. My funny and pretty baby. You’re literally so perfect.</p>
								<p>53. I love how peaceful you look when you’re resting in my arms while we tambay in my car. I wish to witness that every morning and night, years from now.</p>
								<p>54. I love holding your soft hand. </p>
								<p>55. I love that you have goals in life and that you’re working hard to achieve them. When you get tired, baby, just know that I’m here for you.</p>
								<p>56. I love that you have taste in everything. I really admire your brain. Did you know that you’ve somehow influenced my taste in home architecture? Okay, now you know.</p>
								<p>57. I love that you feel like home. Every time we’re together, I get that warm, cozy feeling in my heart. I always feel like I’m exactly where I should be when I’m with you.</p>
								<p>58. I love how you’re open to trying new things, and I hope I’ll always be the person you want to be with when you do them.</p>
								<p>59. I love how you make me feel loved in a way no one ever has. I’ve never felt this wanted before, not until you.</p>
								<p>60. I love how beautiful you look while being bare in front of me. Thank you for trusting me.</p>
								<p>61. I love how beautiful your voice is. When we first talked on the phone, I couldn’t help but gush over your voice. I was smiling the whole time kahit yung topic natin that time kasi stolen airpods mo.</p>
								<p>62. I love how random you are at times. So unpredictable like a blind box. I still love you, din, even though you damay me with your randomness, making me do or say whatever you want.</p>
								<p>63. I love how secure you are. It’s an admirable trait you have.</p>
								<p>64. I love how you reassure me whenever I need it. Thank you:)</p>
								<p>65. I love that you know your priorities.</p>
								<p>66. I love the little noises you make when I kiss your neck.</p>
								<p>67. I love how cute your laugh is when I tickle you. So cute:(</p>
								<p>68. I love that you’re such a bookworm and a math nerd. You’re my hot nerd.</p>
								<p>69. I love how excited you get whenever you open a blind box. How your eyes light up in excitement as you feel the item inside the wrapper.</p>
								<p>70. I love how sexy you are in everything you do. I have to stop myself from kissing you every time. There are times when you try to be funny by making faces, but then I end up finding you attractive when you do them, lol. I’m so lovesick na noh.</p>
								<p>71. I love how you don’t get scared easily when we watch or play anything horror. You’re cool for that. Cooler parin ako though.</p>
								<p>72. I also love your reactions when you do get scared at times. Makes me want to protect you. #AlphaInstinct</p>
								<p>73. I love how you make every mundane thing exciting. Nothing’s too dull when I imagine doing them with you. </p>
								<p>74. I love how you still give me butterflies after all this time.</p>
								<p>75. I love how you turn into a child whenever you come across something that reminds you of your childhood. </p>
								<p>76. I love how beautiful you look while singing along to the song playing in the car. It makes me wish I had a car that could go on autopilot so I could just stare at you instead. </p>
								<p>77. I love that even though you hate being told what to do, you sometimes listen to me. I still love the side of you that doesn’t, though. It’s a reminder that I am dating someone who is strong-willed, and I love that.</p>
								<p>78. I love how when you really want something, you think of any way to obtain it.</p>
								<p>79. I love that I get to experience life with someone who appreciates every aspect of it. I know you grieve about how time flies so fast, and how you wish you could go back to being a kid again; this time, I want to be selfish. I hope we grow up fast so we can be adults together. Traveling everywhere, running errands, and doing anything together.</p>
								<p>80. I love how poetic and artistic your soul is. You’re art itself; the way you think and interpret things.</p>
								<p>81. I love how you love word games or math puzzles, or any game that stimulates you intellectually. I love when you yap about number puzzles, even though I don't get it.</p>
								<p>82. I also love how, at times, you don’t want to think and just want to shut off your mind even for a bit.</p>
								<p>83. I love how you contradict yourself at times. It’s beautiful that you don’t limit yourself to what you think you are. You just feel and live whatever you’re feeling at the moment.</p>
								<p>84. I love how soft your lips are whenever I kiss you. How lucky I am to be kissing the prettiest girl.</p>
								<p>85. I love how soft your body feels against mine when we cuddle with each other. So comforting.</p>
								<p>86. I love how you make me emotional just by thinking of you. I’ve somehow evolved to be a softie when it comes to you.</p>
								<p>87. I love how beautiful you look with your glasses on. My pretty baby:(</p>
								<p>88. I love how beautiful you look without them. How come you look so perfect either way? However, I have beef with your contact lens kasi di ka makarest with it on.</p>
								<p>89. I love how you allow me to touch you on parts only I can touch. Thank you for trusting me:(</p>
								<p>90. I love that you’ve taught me love can be this beautiful. Thank you.</p>
								<p>91. I love how you’ve given me the peace no one else can.</p>
								<p>92. I love you both in your good and bad days. Please keep in mind that I will always stay.</p>
								<p>93. I love how you’ve taught me to be a better person. I catch myself reflecting on every action I’ve done, so I know how I can improve to be a better partner for you.</p>
								<p>94. I love how soft your cheeks feel against my hand whenever I cup them. I hope by doing so, you can feel how gentle I try to be with you. In my heart, I see you as this fragile little girl who deserves to be loved gently.</p>
								<p>95. I love how you show that you care in your own little ways. May it be asking me if I’m okay whenever I go unusually quiet or if I’m comfortable in our cuddle position.</p>
								<p>96. I love how you remember even the little details. I’m still amazed at how you do it.</p>
								<p>97. I love that you still stayed despite having witnessed my imperfections.</p>
								<p>98. I love that we can be childish together like this oh 👌 lol you looked!</p>
								<p>99. I love how you love me. I’m glad that it’s you who has proven me wrong about everything. I grew up thinking no one would truly love me because of my defect, so thank you:)</p>
								<p>100. I love YOU. Every little and big thing that makes you who you are. I love and will always love them all. </p>
								
								<p>I love you, my Chesnut. </p>
